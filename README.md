# MarkovMemes
Machine Learning Meme Generator.

The objective for this project to build a self-automated bot that learns how to craft its own memes.
This is achieved my running a twitter scrapper which will gather tweets from popular meme accounts to help 
improve the model.

Issues: How to filter sample set to include only memes? Lots of "meme" accounts post variable content.
